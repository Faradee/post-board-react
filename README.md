# React post board
This is my first major project using React.

The project's goal is to help me develop skills necessary for building high-quality web applications via MERN stack.

It's an app where i want to implement most of the average forum functionality with small features on the side there and there.

For the time being i'm using JSON server as the project's database, db.json is the database file.

Any feedback regarding the project is welcome. :)

# Todos
* Sign-in and log-in features
* Notification box which informs the user when he signs in/makes a post/deletes a post/etc.
* Implement a DECENT back-end using Node-express and MongoDB
* Add user info to posts
* Add admin features
* Live updating post board
* Add quality of life features regarding posts and UX.
* if i have enough mental capacity left after i've added the features above maybe i'll do some fancy styling with CSS
